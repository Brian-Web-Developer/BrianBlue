              <h1 class="mb-5">Don't Get Stuck, Embrace Mindfulness and Introspection as a tool for Clarity</h1>
              <p><em><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>f the Bracelet fits, then wear it, if it doesn't then throw it away no matter how beautiful it is’.</em> A few weeks ago I was watching 'The Situation Room' which airs on KTN Home and Spice FM every weekday morning when I first heard this quote (This is not a paid promotion). The show is mostly politics-oriented but I will focus on an activity that they always engage all of their interviewees in. Eric Latiff and CT Muga, the hosts, pitch a random quote (Mostly from an African ethnicity) to their guests and challenge them to make their interpretations. One fascinating thing about proverbs is that everyone always tends to have his/her own interpretation based on their understanding of life. This quote was mentioned on the show;  it is a Kenyan Proverb but I am not sure from which specific tribe it originated, please enlighten me if you know. My interpretation is that life should grant you environments that give you peace as you thrive, not one that grants you one option in lieu of the other. So why am I starting off this article with this quote, well it aligns with my rationale for taking on a Mindfulness and Introspection Journey.</p>

              </figure>
              



              <p>So What are Mindfulness and Introspection to begin with? Mindfulness is the quality and state achieved when you focus on the present moment, accepting and acknowledging your thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations. Introspection is the observation of your own mental and emotional processes, spiritually it means observing one’s soul. Together these two form a duo that is co-dependent in therapeutic processes and maintaining good mental health. June has been <a href="https://thriveworks.com/help-with/mental-health-awareness/mens-mental-health-month/#:~:text=What%20Month%20Is%20Men's%20Mental,well%2Dbeing%2C%20as%20well." target="_blank"><strong>Men’s Mental Health Month </strong></a> and I am sure you did not know about this beforehand, If you did then kudos. Mindfulness plays a big part in dealing with mental health issues. I’m not going to delve much into Mental Health but rather share my Mindfulness journey, the rationale and my experience.</p> 
              <p>Through Mindfulness and Introspection, individuals develop an awareness of their thoughts, emotions, and sensations, allowing them to observe and understand them without judgment. When you read ‘mindfulness and meditation’ you probably pictured yourself folding your feet together into your thighs, thumbs and index fingers gently, chimes bouncing on each other, green grass, a Chinese bell, gently blowing wind and a smell of fresh air. While these may be prerogatives for the ‘most experienced meditators’ like monks, mindfulness is more of the mind-body connection than your posture or your environment. In simpler terms, you can practice mindfulness anywhere from walking down the street, to sitting in a public space, all you need is to avoid distractions and focus on yourself for 15 minutes, give or take. This heightened self-awareness will enable you to gain clarity as you gain a deeper understanding of your values, desires, and motivations. Overall, a mindfulness and introspection journey will provide you with a powerful framework for self-discovery and personal development, enhancing clarity, emotional intelligence, and resilience in the face of life's challenges.</p>

              <p> I had recently found myself in an abyss of festering doubt, fear and uncertainty with the many options I had to pursue in my career and life in its entirety. I have grown up grappling with the identity of being indecisive and maybe I can attribute this to the fact that I am a firstborn who made every decision himself and the pressure of dissecting and distinguishing the wrong from the Okay ones was almost palpable when the decision for my life direction rested entirely on me. So I had to acclimate to this ‘decision-making for myself’ regime on a ‘try and find out basis.’ Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for having that kind of environment, my rudimentary knowledge had me grow my curiosity and my choice-questioning habits have led me to the great person I am today.</p>

              <p>
                My goal for Mindfulness & Introspection was therefore to find clarity and to gain candid knowledge of which bracelet would fit from a bunch in my repertoire. A few weeks ago, my predicament with clarity led me to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382" target="_blank"><strong> Essentialism by Greg Mckeown </strong></a>. If I could sum up the book into one sentence, it would be that we wear ourselves out by focusing our energy on many non-essential goals and if we direct that energy purposefully and feed it into one goal, we will almost certainly progress 10 times faster. I can count the number of times I have felt lost or felt uncertain in life and I know everyone feels lost in life at some point but mine kind of ‘lost’was different.  I used to believe that decisions are either wrong or right but most times they’re neither, sometimes they are just decisions and you have to make them because not choosing is also a decision, so is your decision the right one? Only time can tell. As an individual or an adult in their 20s, having a goal-oriented life and a clear vision of what you want to become and what you do not want to become should be considered a top-notch skill because nothing leads to a healthier mind and purposeful life than clarity of your life goals. I had to embrace the process of getting rid of ‘unnecessary clutter’ or as George Mckeown calls it ‘editing out the non-essential things to avoid the overwhelm’. In My pursuit for clarity, I followed these steps which I am certain you will find value in them.</p>

                <h2>The Methodology</h2>

              <p>Let’s get you going on this, first, you need to have goals for the journey. I had scribbled a lot of targets for this miniature 30-day marathon but all of them could be just summed into one main goal which was Clarity. So in the spirit of searching for clarity came the need to have an organized chart of laid-out steps, a roadmap that I could follow suit for the whole of June (You can find the google sheets File <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hPewSCk0QZaIYHpd6at3jH3CKCythK1w008s4-ZtEvo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><strong>Here</strong></a>. I also got two friends to join me so as to get different views of their goals, their own experience and lessons from this program. They also helped push me to pursue this goal to completion. You will realise that Mindfulness meditation and Introspection are easy once you get yourself going. The main goal was to observe all my emotions, my thinking, and my reactions to events. In simpler terms, it is viewing your life from a third-person perspective and noting every new thing you learn about yourself. Fun fact, did you know that some evil-doers always think they are good people and are doing good? It's all in their delusional moral self-justification which we sometimes adapt to as a defence mechanism for our wrongs. I also set a reminder on my phone for the exercise and whenever it rang, I would sit for 15 minutes and conduct a deep mindfulness introspection without judgement and write down my feelings, thoughts and experiences, regardless of the location. With all that in mind, I was good to go.</p>



            
                <h2>Findings</h2>
               <p> This is a documentation of all the 8 hours I spent Introspecting, meditating and practising mindfulness for the whole month of June. These tips are intertwined with my core goal of finding clarity through introspection and mindfulness. I had peaceful moments of clarity when I jotted them down. </p>
               <p>


               </p>
                <ul>
                  
                      <li><h4 >Awareness is Everything</h4> Awareness is Everything. I want you to pause and focus on your breathing for a second, notice how you are breathing in and out right now. Don't do anything else, just watch yourself as you breathe in and out, it doesn't have to be deep breaths.  Did you get a little freaked out that you are using a little more energy to breathe, it is like you are in manual mode and totally in control of your respiratory action, contrary to the normal automatic breathing that happens every day and you barely notice. This is exactly what awareness is, basically taking manual control and noticing your thoughts, and emotions and therefore having good judgement about them. Awareness will grant you passage through the gates of clarity by showing you your actions and thoughts in real time as they happen. Think of awareness like rain falling on you, I mean normally you would just feel like it's rain but with awareness, you feel every single drop on your skin, and in your hair, you feel the drops’ temperatures as they trickle down your skin. The same applies to emotions, if it's anger, you feel it as it grows and sweeps through your body. Awareness will change your perception and reaction to normal situations and scenarios.</li>

                      <p></p>

                      <li><h4>Be Grounded</h4><a href="https://www.theyoganomads.com/staying-grounded-meaning/#:~:text=To%20be%20grounded%20means%20to,secure%2C%20stable%2C%20and%20settled." target="_blank"><strong>The Yoga Nomads</strong></a> define grounded as the act of being present and in touch with your body and earth. Embrace the ordinary things in life, these can be simple activities like sitting and taking deep breaths, painting, or performing any activity that brings out all the senses and makes you feel secure, stable and settled. When you are grounded, you are calm, unshakable and not swayed by the energy or people around you. Being grounded and Awareness are mutually dependent</li>
                      <p></p>
                        
                      <li> <h4>Reduce your Social Media time</h4> One of the goals of this exercise was to cut back on the use of digital devices. Quick question, If Invited you to a Bonfire adventure on a Yatch in Kilifi and I told you that  Sauti Sol and Nyashinski, hypothetically,  would be performing and on top of that you get to meet and interact with them in person but there is only one catch, you can't take any pictures or share anything about it on social media. If you feel a little uncomfortable with that then I have bad news, you are a social media slave. Take some time of digital devices and social media and reconnect with the actual world. Embrace personal interactions as opposed to those on social media.</li>
                      <p></p>
                        
                      <li> <h4>Take a Step Back</h4> Whenever situations get overwhelming, take a step back and look at them from a third-person perspective. Don't let emotions spiral out of control. Take some time off (Two days) to gain clarity.</li>
                      <p></p>
                        
                        <li><h4>Keep Walking</h4> One of the core reasons that lead to mental health issues like depression and low sense of worth for individuals in their 20s is linked to is lack of purpose. When you keep growing, whether healthwise, financially, academically or even physically life becomes purposeful when you have a goal to achieve, something to take care of or look forward to. I always sum this up with one of my life mantras and that is, Living is looking forward to something. Think about it, we are always looking forward to something, looking forward to getting some good news, seeing someone, getting a degree, starting projects, and even finishing that beef that you left in the fridge last night. Now imagine if you didn't have anything to look forward to or take care of, life would lose interest and you would crumble. This is the reason why single lonely people tend to have many pets, they need something to take care of (Totally pun intended and no offence to pet owners). So when life falls apart, get something to grow,  look after, nurture and look forward to doing every day. Not a Drinker but I like <a href="https://www.johnniewalker.com/en/" target="_blank"><strong>Johnnie Walker's</strong></a> slogan, just Keep Walking.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        
                        <li><h4>Be Honest With Yourself</h4> Be honest with yourself. What story do you tell yourself? Lying to ourselves is a coping mechanism and sometimes we have to just step on the gorilla’s toe and get a whack of clear distinction between hope and delusion in our lives. 90% of the time you will not realise you are being delusional until reality hits you.  Mindful clarity is not only remaining calm and unaffected in stressful situations, it's also the ability to focus on what's most important, ignore outside distractions, and see things for what they are</li>
                        <p></p>
                        
                      <li>  <h4>Master Emotional Intelligence</h4>Don’t be hard on your feelings and thoughts, learn to embrace them without judgement. In addition, learn to not give the things you can't control your mind space. As I wrote when I started on this journey, we are not what we think and feel but just observers. So observe your thoughts and emotions and then decide what to do with them.</li>
                      <p></p>
                        
                        <li><h4>Give yourself Time</h4>  It takes time to grow a craft, to develop a mindset, to rid a behaviour.  Time is the most frustrating and most valuable asset in our arsenal so you have no option but to submit to its prowess. Think of it like swimming, the water will carry you only if you let it. Time will also grant you great results only if you allow it. Time brings back perspective, and reflection brings clarity.
                        
                        </li>
                        <p></p>
                        
                        <li><h4>In retrospect to clarity, Learn to look at long-term goals.</h4>  If you are reading this I am presuming that you are an adult. What are your long-term goals with what you are investing your time and energy into, does it align with the person you want to become? Part of the reason I end up getting lost sometimes is that I put my whole focus into something which at the time is Okay but after concluding it, I am back to the ground digging. The most important projects should be aligned to your desired identity in 5 years or 10 years.</li>
                        
                  
              </ul>
          
              </p>
              <p></p>

              <h3>So What's Your Takeaway? </h3>
              <p>One of the biggest fears in life is failing to live to your full potential and we cannot culminate to our potential if we lack clarity of our goals. In my two decades of existence I have realised that we often downplay and undervalue our greatest strengths, we mostly assume that everyone else can do it when in reality, not everyone can do it the way you do. I hope this helps you find clarity in your goals and ambitions in whichever aspect of life you are stuck in and most importantly, find that thing you do like no one else does.</p>

              </figure>

              <p>I have to however warn you that clarity is not a ‘Once you tap into it, you cannot lose it’ kind of phenomenon, you will lose it from time to time, especially after you’ve achieved something (I know I do). Success is synonymous with mental well-being and clarity will give you purpose and a purpose-driven life is a minimal-stress life. And when you are wearing your warmest clothes during heavy downpours, remember to remain calm and focused on your goals. It gets really foggy during some heavy downpours and this makes it hard to see through. Sometimes all you’re gonna need is just a cup of coffee and a little patience for the storm to pass, sometimes you are going to need way more than that, whatever clears the fog for you and restores your vision. I hope that this mindfulness and introspection exercise will work great for you as it did for me. Ensure you practice it every once in a while a your mind is your biggest asset and a healthy mind paves the way for great achievements. Good luck.</p>

              <p>Peace</p>
